## PEP School V2 | January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis identifies both **program strengths** to maintain and **foundational skill gaps** that persist across grade levels. The findings support a move toward mastery-based learning by identifying specific skills that need remediation at each level.

**Program Strengths - Skills Consistently ≥70% Across Multiple Grades:**
1. **Grammar Usage** (English): 73-81% in Grades 3-6 - only drops in Grade 7
2. **Arithmetic Operations** (Maths): 73-80% in Grades 3-4, 78% in Grade 6
3. **Fractions** (Maths): 63-74% stable across Grades 4-7
4. **Vocabulary/Word Meaning** (English): 67-90% with consistent growth Grades 3-6

**Key Areas for Improvement:**
1. Spelling/Phonics weak in Grades 3-5 (58-64%), only reaches 83% by Grade 6
2. Real-world math applications critically weak (48%) in Grade 3
3. Scientific explanation skills weak across ALL elementary grades (44-61%)
4. Sharp performance cliff in Grade 7 across all subjects
5. 15+ students struggling across ALL THREE subjects need holistic intervention

---

## SECTION 1: Program Strengths - Skills We Do Well

These are skills where performance is **consistently ≥70% across 3+ grades** or shows **steady improvement** year over year. These represent effective instruction that should be maintained.

### Criteria for "Strength"
- Performance ≥70% in at least 3 grade levels, OR
- Consistent upward trend across grades (improving by 10%+ from Grade 3 to Grade 7)

### ENGLISH - Consistently Strong Skills

| Skill | Gr 3 | Gr 4 | Gr 5 | Gr 6 | Gr 7 | Assessment |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------------|
| **Grammar Usage** | 77% | 73% | 75% | 81% | 63% | **STRONG** in Gr 3-6 (all ≥73%) |
| **Vocabulary/Word Meaning** | 67% | 71% | 80% | 90% | 79% | **STRONG** - consistent growth, ≥70% in 4 grades |
| **Inferential Analysis** | 62% | 76% | 84% | 84% | 73% | **STRONG** from Gr 4 onwards (all ≥73%) |
| **Punctuation** | 59% | 63% | 75% | 85% | 76% | **IMPROVING** - reaches ≥75% by Gr 5 |

**What This Tells Us**: Grammar and vocabulary instruction is effective. Students who struggle early with inference catch up by Grade 4 and maintain good performance.

### MATHS - Consistently Strong Skills

| Skill | Gr 3 | Gr 4 | Gr 5 | Gr 6 | Gr 7 | Assessment |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------------|
| **Arithmetic Operations** | 73% | 80% | 59% | 78% | - | **STRONG** in 3 of 4 grades (≥73%) |
| **Number Sense** | 71% | 80% | 69% | 65% | 63% | **MIXED** - strong start, declines |
| **Fractions** | - | 74% | 63% | 64% | 65% | **STABLE** - maintains 63-74% |
| **Geometry** | 59% | 67% | 57% | 84% | 72% | **IMPROVING** - reaches ≥70% by Gr 6-7 |

**What This Tells Us**: Basic computation (arithmetic) is taught well. Fractions maintain stability which is positive. Number sense starts strong but needs reinforcement in upper grades.

### SCIENCE - Consistently Strong Skills

| Skill | Gr 3 | Gr 4 | Gr 5 | Gr 6 | Gr 7 | Assessment |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------------|
| **Recall & Recognition** | 61% | 75% | 73% | 80% | 61% | **STRONG** in Gr 4-6 (all ≥73%) |
| **Classification** | 60% | 75% | 68% | 71% | 50% | **MODERATE** - ≥70% in 2 grades |
| **Data Analysis** | 64% | 65% | 67% | 75% | 55% | **IMPROVING** through Gr 6, drops in Gr 7 |

**What This Tells Us**: Factual recall and classification are taught effectively in middle elementary. However, no science skill maintains ≥70% across all grades - this is a concern.

### Summary: Skills That Are Working

| Subject | Skill | Why It's Working |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| English | Grammar Usage | Consistent ≥73% in 4 grades - systematic instruction |
| English | Vocabulary | Steady improvement every year - spiraling curriculum |
| English | Inference | Once learned (Gr 4), stays strong - good scaffolding |
| Maths | Arithmetic | ≥73% in most grades - regular practice |
| Maths | Fractions | Stable 63-74% - maintained through practice |
| Science | Recall | ≥73% in Gr 4-6 - effective memorization strategies |

### Key Observations

1. **English has the most consistent strengths** - Grammar, vocabulary, and inference are reliably strong
2. **Maths arithmetic is solid** - Basic computation skills are well-developed
3. **Science has NO skill that stays ≥70% across all grades** - Even "strong" science skills drop in Grade 7
4. **Grade 7 is a problem across all subjects** - Even strong skills decline sharply

### Recommendations to Maintain Strengths

1. **Protect grammar and vocabulary instruction time** - These are working, don't reduce them
2. **Continue regular arithmetic practice** - The consistent drilling is paying off
3. **Study what's working in inference instruction** - Can similar scaffolding help with scientific explanation?
4. **Don't assume skills stay strong** - Grade 7 drops suggest need for reinforcement even in "strong" areas

## SECTION 2: Foundational Gaps in Grades 3-4 (Areas for Improvement)

These skills are weak in the early years and should be prioritized for mastery before students advance:

### ENGLISH - Foundational Gaps

| Skill | Grade 3 | Grade 4 | Status |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Spelling & Phonics** | 58% | 58% | CRITICAL - Unchanged across 2 years |
| **Punctuation & Sentence Formation** | 59% | 63% | Weak in both grades |
| **Text Organization & Context** | 58% | 62% | Weak in both grades |
| **Identifies & Recalls Facts** | 60% | 80% | Improves, but weak start |
| **Analyses & Infers Hidden Ideas** | 62% | 76% | Improves by Grade 4 |

**Insight**: Students are moving to higher grades without mastering basic writing mechanics. This affects their ability to construct coherent written responses across all subjects.

### MATHS - Foundational Gaps

| Skill | Grade 3 | Grade 4 | Status |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Real-world Applications (money, time, measurement)** | 48% | 63% | CRITICAL - Grade 3 severely weak |
| **Problem Solving (advanced)** | 53% | 64% | Weak in both grades |
| **Basic Geometry** | 59% | 67% | Improving but started weak |
| **Number Sense** | 71% | 80% | Good progression |
| **Arithmetic Operations** | 73% | 80% | Good progression |

**Insight**: The 48% in Grade 3 real-world applications is alarming. Students cannot apply math to daily contexts, which means procedural knowledge isn't translating to understanding.

### SCIENCE - Foundational Gaps

| Skill | Grade 3 | Grade 4 | Status |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Explaining Scientific Processes** | 61% | 57% | GETTING WORSE |
| **Hypothesis & Prediction** | 58% | 51% | GETTING WORSE |
| **Applying Knowledge** | 61% | 48% | CRITICAL DROP |
| **Classification/Comparison** | 60% | 75% | Improves |
| **Recall & Recognition** | 61% | 75% | Improves |

**Insight**: Students are not developing scientific thinking skills. They can memorize but cannot explain "why" or predict "what if." This is a fundamental gap in scientific literacy.

---

## SECTION 3: Skills That Never Get Fixed (Persistent Weaknesses)

These skills remain weak across **3+ grade levels**, indicating systemic instructional gaps:

### Skills Weak in 3+ Grades

| Subject | Skill | Grades Affected | Pattern |
|---------|-------|-----------------|---------|
| **Science** | Explaining scientific processes | 3-A(61%), 4-A(57%), 5-A(44%), 6-A(52%) | Weak across ALL elementary |
| **Science** | Hypothesis & Prediction | 3-A(58%), 4-A(51%), 5-A(48%) | Weak until Grade 6 |
| **English** | Spelling & Phonics | 3-A(58%), 4-A(58%), 5-A(64%) | Weak until Grade 6 |
| **English** | Text Organization | 3-A(58%), 4-A(62%), 6-A(59%) | Recurring weakness |
| **Maths** | Real-world Applications | 3-A(48%), 4-A(63%), 5-A(51%) | Never mastered in elementary |
| **Maths** | Problem Solving | 3-A(53%), 4-A(64%), 7-A(62%) | Returns as weakness in Grade 7 |

**Key Insight**: These are not individual student issues - they are **curriculum/instruction gaps** that need school-wide intervention.

## SECTION 4: Skill Progression Analysis

### Skills That IMPROVE Over Time (What's Working)

| Subject | Skill Theme | Grade 3 | Grade 6/7 | Change |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| English | Spelling & Phonics | 58% | 83% | +25% |
| English | Inferential Reading | 62% | 84% | +22% |
| Science | Hypothesis & Prediction | 58% | 79% | +21% |
| Maths | Geometry | 59% | 84% | +25% |

**Insight**: These skills DO improve, which means instruction works - it just takes until Grade 6. Consider: **Can we accelerate this mastery?**

### Skills That DECLINE or Stay Flat

| Subject | Skill Theme | Progression | Trend |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Maths | Word Problems | 60%→66%→49%→78%→67% | Unstable |
| Maths | Problem Solving | 53%→64%→70%→71%→62% | Drops in Gr 7 |
| Maths | Number Sense | 71%→80%→69%→65%→63% | Declining |
| Science | Scientific Explanation | 61%→57%→44%→52%→70% | Weak until Gr 7 |

---

## SECTION 5: Grade 7 Performance Cliff

Grade 7 shows sharp declines compared to Grade 6 in multiple areas:

| Subject | Skill | Grade 6 | Grade 7 | Drop |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|------|
| Science | Recall & Recognition | 80% | 61% | **-19%** |
| Science | Data Analysis | 75% | 55% | **-20%** |
| Science | Classification | 71% | 50% | **-21%** |
| English | Grammar Usage | 81% | 63% | **-18%** |
| English | Vocabulary | 90% | 64% | **-26%** |
| Maths | Problem Solving | 71% | 62% | **-9%** |
| Maths | Algebra (new) | - | 53% | NEW & WEAK |

**Possible Causes:**
1. Curriculum jump in complexity at Grade 7
2. Different teaching approach/expectations in middle school
3. Foundational gaps finally catching up
4. Algebra introduction without sufficient pre-algebra foundation

## SECTION 6: Weak Student Analysis

### Students Struggling Across ALL THREE Subjects

These students need **holistic intervention** - they are not struggling in just one area:

**Grade 3 (8 students - URGENT):**
- KHUSHIKA R LOMADA
- VIKRANT K REDDY
- VIRAJ A ARAVIND
- AMAL SHYAM
- ABHIRAM DONDETI
- DISHA THANGAMMA
- IVAAN HARSH
- MAUSAM P G

**Grade 4 (4 students):**
- AKSHATH V IYER
- ATHARV R ACHARYA
- DISHA PUNEETH
- MANASVITHA BOJJA

**Grade 5 (3 students):**
- AARON NEIL
- AVYUKT NA
- DHWANI ARUN

**Grade 7 (3 students):**
- EKAANSH PRASAD
- SHUBHI GOGOI
- ABHIGYA V URS

### Do Weak Students Share Common Skill Gaps?

**YES.** Analyzing students struggling across all subjects reveals common patterns:

#### Pattern 1: Application & Transfer Weakness
These students consistently struggle with:
- Applying knowledge to new situations
- Transferring learning from one context to another
- Word problems and real-world applications

This suggests they may understand procedures but lack conceptual understanding.

#### Pattern 2: Higher-Order Thinking Weakness
Common weak skills among struggling students:
- **Science**: Hypothesis formulation, explaining processes
- **Maths**: Problem solving, advanced applications
- **English**: Inferring hidden ideas, analyzing text

These are all Bloom's Taxonomy higher-order skills (analysis, evaluation, synthesis).

#### Pattern 3: Language Processing Connection
Many students weak across subjects also show:
- Low comprehension scores in English
- Difficulty with word problems in Math
- Struggle with scientific explanations

**Insight**: Language processing may be a root cause. If students can't comprehend complex text, they struggle across ALL subjects.

### Students with Most Skill Gaps (Top Concern List)

| Student | Grade | English Skills Weak | Maths Skills Weak | Science Skills Weak |
|---------|-------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| EKAANSH PRASAD | 7-A | 10 | 8 | 6 |
| KHUSHIKA R LOMADA | 3-A | 9 | 7 | 7 |
| VIKRANT K REDDY | 3-A | 9 | 7 | 5 |
| AARON NEIL | 5-A | 9 | 8 | 8 |
| AKSHATH V IYER | 4-A | 9 | 6 | 5 |
| SHUBHI GOGOI | 7-A | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| ABHIGYA V URS | 7-A | 5 | 9 | 5 |

### Students with Unusual Skill Profiles

These students show atypical patterns that warrant individual attention - they may have specific learning differences, gaps in instruction, or unique learning styles.

#### Category 1: High Performers with Blind Spots (Avg ≥75% but one skill ≤40%)

These students are strong overall but have one glaring weakness:

| Student | Grade | Overall Avg | Blind Spot Skill |
|---------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| ANSHIKA KASLIWAL | 6-A | 90% | English: Identifies main idea (33%) |
| NEVILLE AMBROSE | 4-A | 90% | English: Text organization (33%) |
| ISHAN GAJJALA | 3-A | 88% | Maths: Daily life applications (33%) |
| ZIVA ADIL | 3-A | 87% | Maths: Daily life applications (33%) |
| SAYAN RAJAKUMAR | 6-A | 86% | English: Identifies main idea (33%) |
| NITHIL AMBROSE | 6-A | 85% | English: Identifies main idea (33%) |

**Pattern**: Multiple Grade 6 students struggle with "Identifies main idea" despite high overall performance. This specific skill may need targeted instruction.

**Recommendation**: These students need focused mini-lessons on their specific blind spot, not general remediation.

#### Category 2: Subject Specialists (≥80% in one subject, ≤50% in another)

These students show extreme subject-specific strengths:

| Student | Grade | Strong Subject | Weak Subject |
|---------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| SHLOK N SRIVASTAVA | 7-A | English: 83% | Maths: 45% |
| KYRA B JOSEPH | 5-A | English: 80% | Maths: 45% |

**Possible Causes**: Different learning styles, gaps in foundational math skills, or anxiety/attitude toward math.

**Recommendation**: Investigate if math weakness is skill-based or attitude-based. Consider leveraging their English strength (reading about math, word-based math approaches).

#### Category 3: Inverted Skill Patterns (Strong in advanced, weak in basics)

These students show an unusual pattern where they perform better on advanced/higher-order skills than on basic/foundational skills:

| Student | Grade | Basic Skills Avg | Advanced Skills Avg | Gap |
|---------|-------|------------------|---------------------|-----|
| ANIK R KOLLI | 7-A | 53% | 88% | +34% |
| AAKASH ARULKUMAR | 6-A | 51% | 78% | +27% |
| NUHA M ADIL | 6-A | 46% | 69% | +23% |

**What This Means**: These students can analyze, infer, and problem-solve but struggle with basic recall, spelling, or arithmetic. This is counterintuitive and suggests:
- Possible attention/focus issues with "boring" basic work
- May have learned to compensate with reasoning skills
- Could indicate specific learning differences (e.g., dyslexia with strong comprehension)

**Recommendation**: Do NOT force basic drill - instead, investigate why basics are weak while advanced skills are strong. Consider learning difference screening.

#### Category 4: Extreme Skill Variance Within Same Subject

These students have 100% in some skills and ≤50% in other skills **within the same subject**:

| Student | Grade | Subject | Perfect Skill (100%) | Weak Skill |
|---------|-------|---------|---------------------|------------|
| SRIRAM V KALIDINDI | 4-A | English | Analysis, Recall, Main Idea | Text organization: 0% |
| MANASVITHA BOJJA | 4-A | English | Word meaning, Recall, Grammar | Text organization: 0% |
| MEHDI M VAKIL | 4-A | English | Recall, Main Idea | Text organization: 0% |
| ATHARV R ACHARYA | 4-A | Maths | Daily life, Arithmetic | Problem solving: 0% |
| AARIB N JATU | 5-A | Science | (multiple) | Hypothesis: 0%, Explanation: 0% |

**Pattern**: Grade 4 shows multiple students with 0% in "Text organization" - this may be a teaching/testing gap, not individual issues.

#### Category 5: High Variance Students (100% and ≤40% across subjects)

**69 students** (nearly half) have at least one skill at ≥80% and another at ≤40%. This is a very high number and suggests:

1. Skills are genuinely independent (mastering one doesn't transfer to others)
2. Instruction may be inconsistent across skill areas
3. Assessment may have high variability

**Most extreme examples (100% spread - from 0% to 100%):**

| Student | Grade | Strongest Skill | Weakest Skill |
|---------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| AHANA GOWDA | 3-A | English Inference: 100% | Maths Daily Life: 0% |
| AMAL SHYAM | 3-A | Maths Multiplication: 100% | English Inference: 0%, Maths Applications: 0% |
| VIKRANT K REDDY | 3-A | Science Instruments: 100% | English Word Meaning: 0%, Spelling: 0% |
| MAUSAM P G | 3-A | Maths Multiplication: 100% | English Word Meaning: 0%, Spelling: 0% |

**Insight**: Grade 3 shows the most extreme variance. These students know some things very well but have complete gaps in others. This is characteristic of inconsistent instruction or students who've missed foundational learning.
