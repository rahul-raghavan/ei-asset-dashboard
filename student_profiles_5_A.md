# Class 5-A: Student Profiles for Teachers
**EI ASSET Assessment | January 2026**

---

## The Story of This Class

Class 5-A reveals a significant literacy-numeracy divide. Most students read well—the English median of 78% is respectable—but Maths performance drops off sharply below the top performers. Several students who read fluently struggle significantly with mathematical reasoning.

**Class Medians:** English 78% | Maths 64% | Science 60%

**The big takeaway:** This class reads better than it calculates. The Maths drop-off suggests either an instructional gap in previous grades or a cohort that's stronger on verbal than quantitative reasoning. Either way, targeted Maths intervention is needed for nearly half the class.

## Students Who Are Thriving

### Aadya Agrawal — The Clear Leader
**English 94% | Maths 98% | Science 86%**

Aadya is performing at an exceptional level across all subjects. Her near-perfect Maths score and strong English and Science indicate a student operating well above grade level.

The skill data shows consistent strength with no significant gaps. She's ready for advanced work.

**What Aadya needs:** Enrichment and challenge. Consider independent research projects or working with Grade 6 materials. She should not be held back waiting for the class.

---

### Agastya R Nair — Strong Across the Board
**English 86% | Maths 92% | Science 86%**

Agastya is performing excellently in all subjects. His profile is balanced—no subject significantly weaker than others, no skill gaps that stand out.

**What Agastya needs:** Continue to challenge him alongside Aadya. He's a strong student who should be in the enrichment group.

---

### Anaya V Chouksey — Verbal Star
**English 94% | Maths 85% | Science 77%**

Anaya's English score ties with Aadya for top in the class. Her Maths and Science are also strong, though a step below her verbal performance.

Her profile shows a student who excels with language and communication but is slightly less confident with numbers and science concepts—though still well above median.

**What Anaya needs:** She's thriving. Use her strong verbal skills in cross-curricular ways: have her write explanations of Maths problems or Science concepts to reinforce learning.

---

### Manya Madhan — All-Around Strong
**English 86% | Maths 85% | Science 71%**

Manya is consistently strong in English and Maths, with Science slightly lower but still solid. No significant weaknesses in her skill profile.

**What Manya needs:** Continued enrichment work. She's performing well and should be grouped with the top achievers.

---

### Siddhiksha Katiyar — Strong But Watch Hypothesis Skills
**English 78% | Maths 85% | Science 71%**

Siddhiksha is performing at or above median in all subjects. However, a closer look at Science reveals a specific gap: **hypothesis formulation** and **using scientific instruments** are weak compared to her other Science skills.

She can analyze and extract information, but struggles when asked to predict outcomes or design experiments.

**What Siddhiksha needs:** Practice with "what if" questions in Science. "If we changed X, what would happen?" Prediction and hypothesis skills need explicit development.

---

## Students in the Middle

These students are near median but have patterns worth understanding.

---

### Ira Iyer — Strong English, Maths Geometry Gap
**English 86% | Maths 75% | Science 69%**

Ira is in the top group for English but drops significantly in Maths. Looking at her Maths skills, the gap is specific: **geometry is a major weakness**, while arithmetic and fractions are strong.

In Science, she struggles with **hypothesis formulation** and **integrating concepts**—the higher-order thinking skills.

**What Ira needs:** Targeted geometry instruction—this is a solvable gap. For Science, practice making predictions and connecting ideas across topics.

---

### Kyra B Joseph — English Strong, Maths-Science Lag
**English 80% | Maths 45% | Science 54%**

Here's a striking split. Kyra is above median in English—she reads and comprehends well. But both Maths (45%) and Science (54%) are well below class median.

Her Science profile shows she can analyze trends and formulate hypotheses, but struggles with **extracting and applying knowledge**—she can think but has trouble with content.

**What Kyra needs:** Investigate whether this is an instructional gap or a genuine verbal/quantitative split. Her English strength suggests cognitive ability is there. Maths may need a fresh start with foundational concepts.

---

### Aadya Verma — Strong Thinker, Application Gaps
**English 78% | Maths 70% | Science 77%**

Aadya V. is right around median in all subjects, but her skill profile shows high variance—she's strong in some areas and weak in others, even within subjects.

In English, analysis and vocabulary are strong, but **understanding text organization** drops to 40%. In Maths, arithmetic and fractions are fine, but **practical applications** (money, time) are weak.

**What Aadya V. needs:** She thinks well but misses the "big picture" structure. Work on connecting ideas: "How does this paragraph lead to the next one?" "Why do we need this step in the math problem?"

---

### Rose — Reading Strong, Math Struggles
**English 82% | Maths 52% | Science 60%**

Rose is a strong reader (82% in English) with good analysis and vocabulary skills. But her Maths drops to 52%—below median.

Her English-Math split is notable. She can analyze text but struggles with numbers.

**What Rose needs:** This is a classic verbal/quantitative split. Don't let Maths weakness create anxiety—use her reading strength to approach Maths through word problem comprehension. "Let's read this problem and figure out what it's really asking."

---

### Rishita Shah — The Maths Puzzle
**English 74% | Maths 30% | Science 40%**

Rishita reads reasonably well (74% in English) but her Maths score of 30% is among the lowest in class—a 44-point gap between English and Maths.

Her Science is also low at 40%, but the Maths struggle is the main concern.

**What Rishita needs:** Urgent Maths intervention. This isn't a "weak student"—her English proves she can learn. Something specific is blocking her mathematical development. Go back to foundational concepts and identify where the gap began.

---

### Aarib N Jatu — Strong Thinker, Content Gaps
**English 70% | Maths 72% | Science 34%**

Aarib is near median in English and Maths, but his Science drops dramatically to 34%. Looking at his Science skills, he struggles with everything except basic fact recall.

Interestingly, his Maths shows similar variance—strong on word problems and arithmetic, weak on geometry and fractions.

**What Aarib needs:** His profile shows strong reasoning with content gaps. He thinks well but has missed chunks of material. Identify what he doesn't know and teach it directly—he'll catch on quickly.

---

## Students Needing Targeted Support

---

### Bansi Sirigiri — Reading Good, Math Application Weak
**English 68% | Maths 42% | Science 57%**

Bansi is near median in English but struggling in Maths. Looking at her Maths skills, she's actually decent at **measurement and data interpretation** but scores 0% on practical applications like money, time, and word problems.

She can do math when it's abstract but falls apart when it's applied to real-world scenarios.

**What Bansi needs:** Intensive practice with applied mathematics. Use real contexts: shopping, cooking, scheduling. The abstract knowledge is there—the application is missing.

---

### Dhwani Arun — English Strong, Maths Application Blocked
**English 70% | Maths 40% | Science 60%**

Dhwani's profile is similar to Bansi's: decent English and Science, but Maths is struggling. Her Maths skill breakdown is revealing:

- **Advanced problem solving:** 100% (!)
- **Basic applications (money, time, word problems):** 0%

She can solve *hard* problems but can't handle *easy* ones? This is unusual. She may be rushing through "simple" tasks and making careless errors, or she genuinely struggles with real-world contexts.

**What Dhwani needs:** Investigation into why she aces advanced problems but fails basic applications. This isn't a weak math student—something specific is happening with applied contexts.

---

### Ayaansh Narain — Inconsistent Across Skills
**English 56% | Maths 65% | Science 60%**

Ayaansh is slightly below median in English and at/near median in Maths and Science. His skill profile shows variation within subjects—he's not uniformly weak, but not consistently strong either.

In English, his vocabulary and spelling are weak (the mechanics of language). In Science, he's strong on analysis but weak on definitions.

**What Ayaansh needs:** Focus on English mechanics—vocabulary building, spelling practice. His thinking skills are fine; it's the foundational literacy that needs work.

---

### Avyukt NA — Struggling Across the Board
**English 56% | Maths 45% | Science 40%**

Avyukt is below median in all subjects. In English, fact identification is a relative strength, but vocabulary and spelling are weak. Maths and Science show no obvious strengths to build on.

**What Avyukt needs:** Start with literacy foundations—vocabulary and reading. If English improves, Maths and Science should follow. He's struggling to access content because of language barriers.

---

## Students Needing Significant Intervention

---

### Aaron Neil — The Unexpected Profile
**English 28% | Maths 18% | Science 34%**

Aaron's scores are among the lowest in class, but his skill profile contains a surprise:

**In English:**
- Interpreting poetry: 100% (!)
- Analysis and inference: 0%
- Vocabulary: 0%
- Fact recall: 0%

He can interpret the meaning of poems perfectly but can't analyze prose, figure out word meanings, or recall facts. This is bizarre—poetry is usually *harder* than prose.

His Maths is critically low at 18%, but the English pattern suggests something unusual about how his mind works.

**What Aaron needs:** A learning assessment is warranted. The poetry-prose split isn't normal distribution—it suggests a specific cognitive profile that needs understanding before intervention can be effective.

---

### Spruha Shinde — Critical Intervention Needed
**Maths 25%** *(Only Maths data available)*

Spruha appears only in Maths data, with a score of 25%—the lowest in the class. Her skill breakdown shows she's below 50% in every skill, with practical applications at 0%.

**What Spruha needs:** Without English and Science data, it's hard to know if this is Maths-specific or a general struggle. Get full data, then plan intensive Maths intervention starting from foundational concepts.

---

### Arohi B — Missing Full Picture
**Maths 62%** *(Only Maths data available)*

Arohi appears only in Maths data, with a score right around median. Her skills show she's stronger on geometry and number sense, weaker on arithmetic operations.

**What Arohi needs:** Complete data from English and Science to understand her full profile.

---

## Class-Wide Teaching Recommendations

### 1. The Maths Application Gap
Multiple students score well on abstract math but poorly on practical applications (money, time, word problems). This is a class-wide instructional gap.

**Action:** Embed applied mathematics into daily routines. Every math lesson should include a real-world context. "When would you actually use this?"

### 2. Hypothesis and Prediction in Science
The Science median (60%) is lowest of all subjects. A consistent weakness is **hypothesis formulation**—students struggle to predict outcomes.

**Action:** Practice "what if" thinking daily. Before experiments, always ask students to predict. "If we did X, what would happen?"

### 3. The Verbal-Quantitative Split
Many students read well but struggle with math—a 20-30 point gap in some cases. This cohort may be verbally stronger overall.

**Action:** Use verbal strengths to approach math. Have students write about math problems, explain their reasoning in words. "Tell me in a sentence what this problem is asking."

### 4. Poetry vs. Prose (Aaron's Pattern)
One student aced poetry but failed prose comprehension. This is worth noting class-wide: some students may connect better with figurative, creative texts than informational ones.

**Action:** Vary text types. Some students who struggle with textbooks may thrive with poems, stories, and creative non-fiction.
