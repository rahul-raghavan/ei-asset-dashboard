# Class 3-A: Student Profiles for Teachers
**EI ASSET Assessment | January 2026**

---

## The Story of This Class

Class 3-A is a class of contrasts. At the top, we have some genuinely exceptional performers—students like Adil and Ishan who demonstrate mastery across all subjects. At the bottom, several students need significant support. But the most interesting teaching opportunities lie in the middle, where students show surprising strengths alongside gaps that targeted intervention could address.

**Class Medians:** English 79% | Maths 70% | Science 67%

**The big takeaway:** This class reads well but struggles to apply knowledge to real-world situations. The most consistent weakness across nearly every student is "money, time, and calendar applications" in Maths—even among top performers.

---

## Students Who Are Thriving

### Adil S Gupta — The Complete Package
**English 100% | Maths 97% | Science 97%**

Adil is the student every teacher dreams of. But what's remarkable isn't just the scores—it's the *consistency*. There are no skill gaps anywhere. No weakness to work on. This student has either been exceptionally well-taught at home or has an unusual level of cognitive maturity for Grade 3.

**What Adil needs:** Enrichment, not remediation. Consider having him mentor struggling peers—it would benefit both. Give him extension tasks and independent projects. He's ready for Grade 4 content.

---

### Ishan Gajjala — The Strong Reader
**English 97% | Maths 87% | Science 83%**

Ishan's English comprehension is exceptional—only Adil scored higher. He reads deeply, infers meaning, and understands structure. Maths and Science are also strong.

But here's a gap: applications involving **money, time, and calendars** in Maths lag behind his other skills. He can solve abstract problems but stumbles when they're set in real-world contexts.

**What Ishan needs:** Real-world math practice—making change, reading schedules, calendar word problems. Use his reading strength by having him read math problems aloud and identify what they're really asking.

---

### Ziva Adil — Strong and Consistent
**English 94% | Maths 83% | Science 83%**

Ziva performs well across the board with no major weaknesses. Like Ishan, she shows the same **money/time gap** in Maths—excellent at calculations but struggles with practical applications.

**What Ziva needs:** This appears to be a class-wide instructional gap, not an individual weakness. Integrate money and time into daily routines for all students.

## Students with Interesting Profiles

These students reveal teaching opportunities that their overall scores might hide.

---

### Vatsal A Bhabhra — The Literal Thinker
**English 89% | Maths 93% | Science 67%**

Vatsal presents a fascinating profile. He's third in the class in Maths—clearly a mathematical thinker. English is strong overall. But look deeper at his English skills:

- **Vocabulary and literal comprehension:** Excellent
- **Inferring hidden ideas:** 0%

He reads the words but misses the deeper meaning. Vatsal scored at the top of the class but literally cannot "read between the lines." He also dropped to 67% in Science—where success often requires inferring relationships and predicting outcomes.

**What Vatsal needs:** Explicit instruction on inference. Ask him "What does the author *really* mean?" and work through it together. He won't pick this up naturally—you'll need to model your thinking process aloud.

---

### Arit Krishang — Strong Thinker, Messy Writer
**English 77% | Maths 83% | Science 87%**

Arit is quietly one of the most capable students in the class. His Science score is second only to Adil. He excels at **analysis and inference**—the high-order thinking skills.

But his mechanics are weak. In English, punctuation and sentence formation scored only 33%. He likely produces thoughtful work that's technically messy.

**What Arit needs:** Focus on the technical aspects of writing without stifling his thinking. Don't over-correct to the point where he stops taking risks with ideas. Separate "thinking" drafts from "polished" drafts.

---

### Nirvi Jain — Bored by Easy Work?
**English 91% | Maths 70% | Science 70%**

Nirvi is a paradox. She's fourth in English with perfect scores on analysis and inference—she can handle complex thinking. But her Maths sits right at the class median.

Look at her Maths skill breakdown: She scored **100% on advanced problem solving** but only **25% on basic multiplication**.

This isn't a struggling student. This is a student who finds routine work boring and only engages when challenged.

**What Nirvi needs:** Harder problems, not more practice on basics. She's likely rushing through "easy" work and making careless errors. Try giving her the hardest problem first, then the routine practice.

---

### Ahana Gowda — Knows Facts, Struggles to Apply
**English 83% | Maths 70% | Science 80%**

Ahana performs consistently but shows a clear pattern: she knows things but struggles to *use* what she knows.

In Maths, she's strong at multiplication but weak on money/time applications. In Science, she can classify organisms and define terms but struggles to **explain processes**—scoring low on "representing, relating, or explaining scientific phenomena."

**What Ahana needs:** Frequent "explain why" questions. Have her teach concepts to a classmate—explaining forces deeper understanding. Move from "what" questions to "why" and "how" questions.

---

## Students Who Need Targeted Support

These students are below class median but have clear paths forward.

---

### Abhiram Dondeti — Understands Rules, Needs Foundations
**English 49% | Maths 63% | Science 50%**

Abhiram is performing below median in all subjects, but his profile isn't uniform. In English:
- **Grammar usage:** 100% (!)
- **Spelling and phonics:** 20%
- **Inference:** 33%

He knows the rules of language—he just can't apply them fluently. His spelling is holding everything back.

**What Abhiram needs:** Intensive phonics and spelling work. This isn't hopeless—the 100% grammar score proves he can learn rules and apply them. The foundation is shaky, but the cognitive ability is there.

---

### Ivaan Harsh — Numbers Over Words
**English 46% | Maths 67% | Science 47%**

Ivaan shows a split personality between subjects. English and Science are weak, but Maths is near-median with strong number sense and multiplication skills.

Within Maths, he scored **0% on geometry** but **100% on number sense**. He's good with numbers, uncomfortable with shapes and words.

**What Ivaan needs:** Use his math confidence to build other skills. Frame problems mathematically when possible. "This science experiment is like a math problem—what's the pattern?" Leverage his strength rather than constantly targeting his weaknesses.

---

### Guru R Ganta — The Guesser
**English 69% | Maths 73% | Science 47%**

Guru is close to class median in English and Maths but falls off in Science. Within English, he excels at inference and synonyms but struggles with literal **fact recall**. He's an intuitive thinker who guesses meaning rather than reading carefully.

His Science score suffers because Science requires careful observation—not quick intuition.

**What Guru needs:** Slow him down. Teach him to underline answers in the text before responding. "Show me where it says that." His instincts are often right, but he's not verifying his responses.

---

## Students Needing Significant Intervention

These students need focused support. The data reveals they're not uniformly weak—each has something to build on.

---

### Amal Shyam — Overwhelmed by Complexity
**English 34% | Maths 43% | Science 33%**

Amal is struggling across all subjects, but look closer:
- **Punctuation in English:** 67% (above many mid-performers)
- **Multiplication in Maths:** 75%
- **Analysis in English:** 0%
- **Word problems in Maths:** 0%

He can handle discrete, isolated skills. He falls apart when tasks require combining multiple skills or multi-step reasoning.

**What Amal needs:** Break everything into smaller pieces. One skill at a time. Build success with simple tasks before combining them. He's not incapable—he's overwhelmed.

---

### Mausam P G — Literacy is the Bottleneck
**English 29% | Maths 57% | Science 40%**

Mausam's Maths score stands out—it's notably higher than English. Multiplication is a strength. But word problems and money/time applications are very weak.

The pattern suggests his **literacy weakness is dragging down everything else**. He may struggle to understand written problems even when he knows the math.

**What Mausam needs:** Reading support is the priority. Use visual and hands-on math until reading improves. Don't let his math potential stay locked behind a reading barrier.

---

### Dhruva Jainapuor — The Hands-On Learner
**English 37% | Maths 47% | Science 67%**

Here's a surprise: Dhruva's Science score is right at the class median. He's struggling badly in English and Maths but *keeping up* in Science.

Looking at his Science skills, he's strong on classification and using scientific instruments. He learns through doing.

**What Dhruva needs:** He's a kinesthetic learner. Use manipulatives in Maths. Let him build and experiment in Science. Traditional desk work isn't reaching him—hands-on activities will.

---

### Vikrant K Reddy — Build on Science Success
**English 17% | Maths 33% | Science 57%**

Vikrant's English and Maths scores are among the lowest in class. But Science is only 10 points below median—and he scored **100% on using instruments and procedures**.

Like Dhruva, this is a hands-on learner being failed by traditional instruction.

**What Vikrant needs:** Use Science as the entry point. He engages with practical work. Build confidence there, then gradually connect to other subjects. "We measured 250ml of water—let's write about what we did."

---

### Viraj A Aravind — Investigate Before Instructing
**English 29% | Maths 17% | Science 33%**

Viraj scores near the bottom in all subjects. There's no obvious strength to build on in the skill data.

**What Viraj needs:** Before planning instruction, investigate underlying causes. Are there learning differences? Home environment factors? Language barriers? Scores this low across all areas suggest something systemic needs to be addressed. Start with a conversation with parents and perhaps a learning assessment.

---

### Khushika R Lomada — Urgent Intervention Required
**English 9% | Maths 20% | Science 17%**

Khushika's scores indicate she may be struggling with fundamental skills or facing external factors affecting her learning. An English score of 9% in Grade 3 is critical.

**What Khushika needs:** An immediate parent conference. Possible learning assessment. One-on-one support before any group instruction can be effective. This is urgent.

---

## Class-Wide Teaching Recommendations

### 1. Money, Time, and Calendar Applications
This is the most consistent weakness in Maths across *all* performance levels—even top students struggle here. It's clearly an instructional gap, not individual weakness.

**Action:** Integrate into daily routines. Class timekeepers. Pretend stores. "How many days until..." questions every morning.

### 2. Inferring Hidden Meaning
Many students read literally but can't "read between the lines." They can find facts but miss what the author really means.

**Action:** Model your thinking aloud. "The author says X, but what does that tell us about how she feels?" Make the invisible thought process visible.

### 3. Explaining Scientific Processes
Students know facts but can't explain *how* or *why* things work.

**Action:** Use "teach-back"—have students explain concepts to each other. "Explain this to your partner like they've never heard of it."

### 4. Differentiation is Non-Negotiable
This class spans from 9% to 100% in English. Whole-class instruction alone will fail half the students. The top students need enrichment; the bottom students need intervention. Teaching to the middle serves no one well.
