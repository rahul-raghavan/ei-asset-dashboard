# Class 4-A: Student Profiles for Teachers
**EI ASSET Assessment | January 2026**

---

## The Story of This Class

Class 4-A is a relatively small but tightly grouped class. Most students cluster around the median, with clear standouts at the top and only one student requiring intensive intervention. This makes differentiation more manageable than in some other grades.

**Class Medians:** English 72% | Maths 72% | Science 63%

**The big takeaway:** This class has solid literacy and numeracy foundations, but Science is a weak spot—particularly the skill of *extracting and applying knowledge*. Students can memorize facts but struggle to use that information in new contexts.

---

## Students Who Are Thriving

### Eshan J Ajith — The All-Rounder
**English 90% | Maths 98% | Science 89%**

Eshan is the clear academic leader of Class 4-A. His near-perfect Maths score and strong performance across all subjects indicate a student who is well-prepared and cognitively advanced for Grade 4.

The skill data shows no significant weaknesses—he's consistently strong across all areas tested.

**What Eshan needs:** Challenge and enrichment. Consider acceleration in Maths. He could serve as a peer tutor, but balance this with ensuring he's still being challenged himself.

---

### Neville Ambrose — Strong But Watch the Details
**English 90% | Maths 92% | Science 89%**

Neville performs nearly as well as Eshan across all subjects. However, a closer look at English skills reveals something interesting:

- **Analysis and inference:** Excellent
- **Understanding passage organization:** Only 40%

He reads well and thinks deeply, but misses structural elements—how a text is organized, what comes before and after. This could affect his understanding of more complex texts as he advances.

**What Neville needs:** Teach text structure explicitly. "What's the main idea of this paragraph? How does it connect to the next one?" He has the thinking skills; he just needs to notice structure more.

---

### Bali S Shah — Consistently Strong
**English 84% | Maths 88% | Science 83%**

Bali performs consistently in the high 80s across all subjects with no obvious gaps. He's a reliable, well-rounded student.

**What Bali needs:** Continued challenge. He's performing well and should be grouped with the other high achievers for extension activities.

---

### Niharika A Rakesh — English Star, Science Struggles
**English 88% | Maths 72% | Science 63%**

Niharika stands out in English (second in class) but her performance drops to median in Maths and Science. In Science, she struggles specifically with **definitions and descriptions**—she knows general concepts but can't state them precisely.

**What Niharika needs:** Work on precision in Science vocabulary. Have her keep a science glossary. Her English strength should help—use it. "Define photosynthesis like you're writing a dictionary entry."

---

## Students in the Middle

These students are performing at or near class median but have notable patterns worth understanding.

---

### Vedanshi M Garlapati — Strong Performer, One Gap
**English 76% | Maths 88% | Science 74%**

Vedanshi is performing well across subjects, but look at her English skill profile:

- **Analysis and inference:** Excellent
- **Identifying main ideas and facts:** Strong
- **Deducing word meanings:** 33%

She understands texts at a high level but struggles with vocabulary—figuring out what unfamiliar words mean from context.

**What Vedanshi needs:** Vocabulary building, specifically context clues strategies. "When you see a word you don't know, look for clues in the sentence around it." This is a trainable skill.

---

### Srushti R Parui — Steady Across All Areas
**English 84% | Maths 70% | Science 77%**

Srushti is performing well in English and Science, with Maths slightly lower but still solid. No significant skill gaps—she's a consistent, dependable student.

**What Srushti needs:** Continue supporting her growth. No urgent intervention needed.

---

### Siri Hasini — English-Maths Strong, Science Lag
**English 70% | Maths 78% | Science 54%**

Siri is right at median in English and above median in Maths, but drops to 54% in Science. Looking at her Science skills, she struggles with **complex analysis and definitions**—the higher-order thinking required in Science.

Interestingly, her Maths problem-solving is fine, so this isn't a general thinking issue—it's specific to scientific reasoning.

**What Siri needs:** More practice with "science thinking." Ask "why" questions. Make her explain phenomena, not just recall facts. Her Maths logic can transfer if she's taught to apply it to Science.

---

### Manasvitha Bojja — Reading Beats Reasoning
**English 72% | Maths 38% | Science 54%**

Here's a significant split. Manasvitha is at class median in English but well below in Maths and Science.

Her English profile shows she reads well—good at vocabulary and fact recall. But **identifying main ideas** and **understanding organization** are weak. She catches the details but misses the big picture.

In Maths, she's struggling significantly—38% is the second lowest in class.

**What Manasvitha needs:** Focus on the "big picture" skill. In English: "What's this passage mainly about?" In Maths: "What is this problem really asking?" She gets lost in details without seeing overall purpose.

---

### Saanvi Sharma — Strong Grammar, Weak Analysis
**English 72% | Maths 70% | Science 40%**

Saanvi is at median in English and Maths, but her Science score drops to 40%—well below class average.

Looking across her skills, there's a pattern: she's strong on rule-based skills (grammar, basic operations) but weak on **analysis and interpretation**. In Science, she scored poorly on classification and complex analysis.

**What Saanvi needs:** More analytical work. Don't just ask "what" questions—ask "why is this different from that?" Classification and comparison activities would help.

---

### Mehdi M Vakil — Subject Inconsistency
**English 66% | Maths 75% | Science 54%**

Mehdi shows variability across subjects—Maths is his strength, English is slightly below median, Science is weaker.

In English, he struggles with **punctuation and sentence formation** (33%) despite good vocabulary knowledge. He knows words but his written mechanics are weak.

In Science, the gap is in **classification and complex analysis**—the thinking skills rather than recall.

**What Mehdi needs:** Writing mechanics practice in English. In Science, teach him to organize his thinking: "Compare these two things. How are they similar? Different?"

## Students Needing Targeted Support

---

### Atharv R Acharya — The Inconsistent Thinker
**English 58% | Maths 58% | Science 51%**

Atharv is performing below median across all subjects, but his skill profile is wildly uneven:

**In English:**
- Analysis and inference: 100%
- Grammar usage: 100%
- Deducing word meanings: 0%
- Identifying main ideas: 0%

He can analyze deeply and knows grammar rules, but can't figure out what words mean or identify main points. This is an unusual pattern.

**In Maths:**
- Word problems and operations: Strong
- Fractions and real-world applications: 0%

**What Atharv needs:** Investigation into why his skills are so uneven. This isn't a "struggling student"—this is a student with specific processing gaps. Consider whether a learning assessment might reveal a profile (like ADHD or a specific learning difference) that explains the inconsistency.

---

### Sriram V Kalidindi — Decent Scores, Hidden Gaps
**English 58% | Maths 72% | Science 66%**

Sriram's Maths and Science are near median, but English is notably lower. His skill profile shows a pattern:

- Strong on analysis and fact identification
- Weak on vocabulary skills (synonyms, word meanings)

He thinks well but his vocabulary limits his reading comprehension.

**What Sriram needs:** Vocabulary building is the clear priority. Word lists, reading widely, explicit vocabulary instruction. His thinking skills are fine—vocabulary is the bottleneck.

---

### Disha Puneeth — Struggling in Maths and Science
**English 36% | Maths 65% | Science 54%**

Disha's profile is concerning: English is very low at 36%, but she's closer to median in Maths and Science.

In English, she struggles across almost all skills. But she's managing Maths decently, which suggests the issue is literacy-specific, not general cognition.

**What Disha needs:** Intensive English support—likely reading intervention. Her Maths ability shows she can learn; English is the barrier. Check her reading level—she may need materials at a lower grade level temporarily.

---

### Aryan Sumesh — Missing Data
**Maths 80% | Science 63%** *(No English data available)*

Aryan appears only in Maths and Science data. His Maths is strong at 80%, with excellent word problem solving. Science is at median with a gap in complex analysis.

**What Aryan needs:** Once English data is available, assess his full profile. His Maths strength suggests good problem-solving ability.

---

## Students Needing Significant Intervention

---

### Akshath V Iyer — Extreme Inconsistency
**English 44% | Maths 42% | Science 37%**

Akshath is the lowest-performing student in Class 4-A, but his skill profile tells an interesting story:

**The extremes:**
- Identifying main ideas (English): 100%
- Deducing word meanings: 33%
- Analyzing and inferring: 0%
- Multiplication/division (Maths): 0%
- Advanced problem solving: 67%

He can identify the main point of a passage perfectly, but can't analyze it. He can solve advanced problems but can't do basic multiplication. This is not a uniformly weak student—this is a student with a very unusual cognitive profile.

**What Akshath needs:** A thorough learning assessment. These patterns suggest a potential learning difference that's causing specific skill gaps while leaving others intact. Don't treat him as "generally struggling"—figure out what's going on.

## Class-Wide Teaching Recommendations

### 1. Science: Extracting and Applying Knowledge
The class median in Science (63%) is lower than English or Maths, and the consistent weakness is using information in new contexts. Students recall facts but can't transfer them.

**Action:** Move beyond recall questions. "We learned X. Now, what would happen if Y?" Application practice should be a daily Science activity.

### 2. Vocabulary From Context
Multiple students struggle with deducing word meanings from context clues. They need explicit teaching of this skill.

**Action:** When encountering new words, model the process: "I don't know this word. Let me look at the sentence... The clues tell me it probably means..."

### 3. Text Structure Awareness
Several strong readers still miss how texts are organized—they focus on content but not structure.

**Action:** Teach text structures explicitly (problem-solution, compare-contrast, chronological). Use graphic organizers to visualize structure.

### 4. The Atharv/Akshath Pattern
Two students show extreme skill variance. This isn't normal distribution—it suggests something specific about how their minds work.

**Action:** Refer for learning assessments. Understanding their profiles will allow targeted support rather than general remediation.
