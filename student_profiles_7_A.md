# Class 7-A: Student Profiles for Teachers
**EI ASSET Assessment | January 2026**

---

## The Story of This Class

Class 7-A presents a significant teaching challenge: a clear bifurcation between high performers and struggling students. The top half of the class is performing well, with several students excelling. But the bottom half shows serious gaps, particularly in Maths where several students score below 40%.

This isn't a uniformly strong or weak class—it's a tale of two groups that need very different approaches.

**Class Medians:** English 78% | Maths 75% | Science 64%

**The big takeaway:** The Maths distribution is concerning—while the median is 75%, several students fall below 40%, suggesting foundational gaps that have compounded by Grade 7. Algebra is a particular struggle across the class.

## Students Who Are Thriving

### Ayansh Makwana — The Outstanding Performer
**English 87% | Maths 98% | Science 91%**

Ayansh is exceptional across all subjects. His near-perfect Maths and strong English and Science place him at the top of Class 7-A and among the best performers school-wide.

His skill profile shows consistent strength—no significant gaps anywhere.

**What Ayansh needs:** Advanced work. Competition mathematics, independent research, or Grade 8+ materials. He's operating well above grade level and needs to be challenged accordingly.

---

### Anik R Kolli — The Maths Standout
**English 78% | Maths 95% | Science 64%**

Anik's Maths score is the second highest in class at 95%—truly excellent. His English is at median, and Science sits exactly at median too.

The interesting pattern: Anik's quantitative skills far exceed his verbal/scientific reasoning. He's not struggling elsewhere, but Maths is clearly his domain.

**What Anik needs:** Mathematical enrichment specifically. Consider math competitions or independent Maths projects. His other subjects are fine but don't need the same level of challenge.

---

### Myra Ashree — Well-Rounded High Performer
**English 93% | Maths 80% | Science 76%**

Myra leads the class in English at 93% and performs well across all subjects. Her profile is balanced with no significant weaknesses.

**What Myra needs:** Continued enrichment. She's in the top tier and should be grouped with other high achievers for challenging work.

---

### Vedaant Dodamani — Strong Across the Board
**English 88% | Maths 78% | Science 80%**

Vedaant performs consistently in the high 70s-80s across all subjects. Science is particularly strong at 80%—among the highest in class for that subject.

**What Vedaant needs:** Challenge and enrichment. He's performing well and should be stretched.

---

### Trisha Iyer — English-Maths Strong, Science Opportunity
**English 88% | Maths 82% | Science 71%**

Trisha is strong in English and Maths but Science drops to 71%—still solid but below her other subjects. Looking at her Maths skills, there's one gap: **algebra** scored lower than her other Maths skills.

**What Trisha needs:** Some algebra reinforcement, and Science support to bring it up to her English/Maths level. She has the capability—just needs to fill a few gaps.

---

### Archana Misra — Strong Writer, Science Data Gap
**English 87% | Maths 75% | Science 64%**

Archana is at the top of the class in English and right at median in Maths and Science. Her profile shows a verbally strong student.

In Science, she struggles specifically with **data analysis and interpretation**—she can recall facts and make hypotheses but struggles with graphs and data.

**What Archana needs:** Practice with scientific data. Reading graphs, interpreting experiments, analyzing results. This is a trainable skill.

---

## Students in the Middle

These students are performing around median but have patterns worth understanding.

---

### Mythili Shyam — English Strong, Maths Word Problems
**English 88% | Maths 62% | Science 58%**

Mythili is in the top group for English but drops significantly in Maths and Science. Her Maths profile is interesting:

- Algebra and geometry: Strong
- Word problems and integers: Weak

She can handle abstract mathematics but struggles when problems are expressed in words or real-world contexts. This is the opposite of many students' pattern.

**What Mythili needs:** Practice translating word problems into mathematical language. "Read the problem. What operation is it really asking for?" Her abstract skills are fine—it's the translation that's hard.

---

### Shlok N Srivastava — English Solid, Maths Struggle
**English 83% | Maths 45% | Science 53%**

Shlok reads well at 83% in English but both Maths and Science are significantly below median. His Maths is 30 points below median—a serious gap.

Looking at his Maths skills, he shows high variance with specific topics very weak while others are stronger.

**What Shlok needs:** Maths intervention is urgent. His English strength shows cognitive capability; the Maths gap needs direct attention before it compounds further.

---

### Aashmi Iyer — Strong English, Inconsistent Elsewhere
**English 77% | Maths 75% | Science 69%**

Aashmi is near median across all subjects. Her English profile shows a gap: **grammar usage** is weak compared to her comprehension skills.

**What Aashmi needs:** Some grammar review, but overall she's performing solidly. No urgent intervention needed.

---

### Abhigya V Urs — English Good, Maths Critical
**English 75% | Maths 35% | Science 53%**

Abhigya shows a 40-point gap between English and Maths. She reads at near-median level but Maths at 35% is critically low for Grade 7.

Her Science is also below median, but the Maths gap is the main concern.

**What Abhigya needs:** Intensive Maths intervention. This gap is too large to ignore—she's missing foundational skills that will make Grade 8 Maths impossible without support. Go back to identify where her understanding broke down.

---

### Kanav Bhalotia — Interesting Maths Pattern
**English 70% | Maths 78% | Science 71%**

Kanav is near median across all subjects with a slight strength in Maths. But look at his Maths skill profile:

- Geometry and fractions: Strong
- Algebra and word problems: Weak

He handles concrete mathematical concepts but struggles with abstract algebra.

**What Kanav needs:** Algebra-specific support. Make algebra concrete—use visual representations, real objects, before moving to abstract manipulation.

---

### Mohammed A Vakil — Verbal Strong, Quant Weak
**English 73% | Maths 38% | Science 56%**

Mohammed's English is near median, but Maths drops to 38%—well below what's needed for Grade 7. His Science is also below median.

His Maths profile shows weakness across nearly all skills—this isn't one gap, it's a general Maths struggle.

**What Mohammed needs:** Comprehensive Maths intervention starting from foundations. He needs to rebuild from earlier concepts. His English ability shows he can learn—Maths instruction needs a different approach for him.

---

### Milan Waseem — The Puzzle Solver Who Can't Calculate
**English 65% | Maths 55% | Science 62%**

Milan's scores are all below median, but his Maths skill profile reveals something interesting:

- Geometry and advanced problem solving: Strong
- Algebra and factors/multiples: Very weak

He can solve complex puzzles but struggles with routine calculations. This isn't a weak math student—this is a student who finds basic work tedious but engages with challenging problems.

**What Milan needs:** Start with challenging problems to build confidence, then work back to fundamentals. "You solved this hard problem—now let's make sure you can do the building blocks too."

---

## Students Needing Significant Intervention

---

### Shubhi Gogoi — Wide Gaps Across Subjects
**English 37% | Maths 30% | Science 42%**

Shubhi is among the lowest performers in all subjects. However, her skill profiles show surprising islands of strength:

- English: **Understanding idioms and proverbs:** 75%
- Maths: **Integers:** 75%
- Science: **Hypothesis formulation:** 100% (!)

She scored perfectly on hypothesis formulation—the hardest Science skill—while struggling with basic fact recall. Her profile shows she can think at a high level in certain areas but has massive gaps elsewhere.

**What Shubhi needs:** Investigation into this unusual pattern. A student who scores 100% on hypothesis formulation is not generally weak. Something specific is blocking her performance in other areas. A learning assessment could reveal a profile (like a language processing issue or attention-related challenge) that explains the pattern.

---

### Ekaansh Prasad — Critical Across All Subjects
**English 22% | Maths 30% | Science 47%**

Ekaansh is struggling significantly in all subjects, though Science (47%) is notably better than English (22%) or Maths (30%).

His Science is nearly at median—only 17 points below—while English and Maths are critically low.

**What Ekaansh needs:** Investigate whether there are underlying learning differences or other factors. However, his relative Science strength suggests hands-on, practical learning may work better for him than text-based instruction. Use Science as an entry point.

## Class-Wide Teaching Recommendations

### 1. The Algebra Gap
Algebra is a consistent weakness across multiple students—even some strong performers. This is typical for Grade 7 as algebra becomes more abstract.

**Action:** Slow down on algebra instruction. Use manipulatives and visual representations before moving to abstract symbols. "Algebra is just arithmetic with mystery numbers."

### 2. The Maths Bifurcation
The class has a clear split: students at 75%+ and students below 45%. There's almost no middle ground.

**Action:** Two-track Maths instruction may be necessary. The top group needs challenge; the bottom group needs foundational support. Teaching to the median will serve no one.

### 3. Word Problems vs. Abstract Maths
Some students (like Mythili) ace abstract maths but fail word problems. Others (like Milan) solve complex puzzles but struggle with routine calculation. These are different learning profiles.

**Action:** Match problem types to students when building confidence, then gradually introduce their weak areas. Don't assume "good at math" or "bad at math" is uniform.

### 4. The Shubhi Pattern
Shubhi's 100% on hypothesis formulation while scoring 37% overall in English is remarkable. Students with this profile need identification—they may have learning differences that cause uneven performance.

**Action:** Consider learning assessments for students with extreme skill variance. Understanding their cognitive profile enables targeted support.

### 5. Science as an Entry Point
Several struggling students (Ekaansh, Shubhi) show relative strength in Science. Hands-on, practical work may reach them better than text-based instruction.

**Action:** Use lab work and experiments liberally. Some students learn better by doing.
